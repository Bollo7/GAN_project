# GAN_project

### Bachelor Thesis project dedicated to fine-tuning of learning rates for two GAN variations - DCGAN and WGAN

Both networks are adapted to CIFAR-10 dataset and built in PyTorch. Requirements file will be uploaded soon. Even though search space is limited, it is possible to extend it in future work. Additionally, both networks are evaluated with FID after each epoch.
